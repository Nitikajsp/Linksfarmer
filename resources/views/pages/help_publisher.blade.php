                                            LINKSFARMER makes payments twice a month, on the 15th and 28th of each
                                            month. In case these dates are on weekends, payment is made on the immediate
                                            working day. Payments are made via PayPal, which is the sole supported
                                            publisher method. We do not charge any fees from our end, but PayPal might
                                            charge some of its fees. A withdrawal request for payment must be made
                                            before the due date to get timely payments.

                                            In 2025, LINKSFARMER mandates verification of ownership prior to adding
                                            websites. You can verify with Google Analytics 4, HTML file upload, or
                                            manual email verification. GA4 is the quickest way, whereas HTML upload
                                            offers an easy alternative. All verified websites are rewarded with a
                                            "Verified Owner Badge," get improved visibility in the marketplace, and
                                            enjoy unique ownership privileges. This also enables advertisers to see
                                            correct traffic figures for your site.
